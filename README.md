# Mock Interview

I created this program to practice personality interview questions, and to learn C#. Its a relatively simple program containing two classes and a main method. The first class "questions", reads the questions from a designated text file and contains a method which returns a randomized question. The second class processes the question response and pairs it with the question asked. It then writes those to the text file. The user can see their results in the results.txt file after the program finishes running.

If you want to help with the project, contributing to the question list would be the most helpful.

To use this program:
1)  Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2)  In the MockInterview directory, execute:
>dotnet run
3)  Respond to prompts during runtime
4)  Check results/results.txt for a recording of the interview (the file will be overwritten by the next execution so be careful)
